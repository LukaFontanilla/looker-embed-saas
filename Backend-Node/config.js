The following is two hard coded users with different permissions, which is intended to simulate how you would use identifying information
from the headers sent in EmbedSDK.init() to lookup a specific user from your database and grant their permissions / user attributes

In a production application, this config would likely be stored/represented in a user database. The Looker SSO Embed process doesn't automatically hook
into your existing auth system (ie. IDP) so you will need to map app users to Looker Roles and Permissions.
